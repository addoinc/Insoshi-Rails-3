= UUID Generator

Generates universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for use in distributed
applications. Based on {RFC 4122}[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt].


== Download

The latest version of the UUID generator can be found in the Reliable
Messaging project

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/reliable-msg/

For more information

* http://trac.labnotes.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/Ruby/UuidGenerator


== Installation

You can download the sources directly, or install the GEM package
(recommended) with

  gem install uuid

Once installed, create a <tt>uuid.state</tt> file by running

  uuid-setup


== Example

  require_gem 'uuid'

  10.times do
    p UUID.new
  end


== UUID state file

The UUID generator uses a state file (<tt>uuid.state</tt>) to hold the
MAC address and sequence number.

The MAC address is used to generate identifiers that are unique to your
machine, preventing conflicts in distributed applications. The MAC
address is six bytes (48 bit) long. It is automatically extracted from
one of the network cards on your machine by running +ipconfig+
(Windows) or +ifconfig+ (Linux, UNIX, et al). You can override the MAC
address by editing the <tt>uuid.state</tt> file yourself.

The sequence number is incremented each time the UUID generator is
first used by the application, to prevent multiple processes from
generating the same set of identifiers, and deal with changes to the
system clock.

The UUID state file is created with

  uuid-setup

It is created in the installation directory. If you installed the UUID
generator as a Gem, it will be created in the Gem's directory. However,
the UUID generator will look for the <tt>uuid.state</tt> first in the
local directory, and then in the installation directory. You can use
that to maintain separate state files for different applications.
However, make sure they generate unique identifiers by using different
MAC addresses in each state file.
